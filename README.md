# BSAD 384 Term Project: Social Media Platform Database

## 1. Problem Statement & ER Diagram

**Problem Statement:**

This database is designed for a social media platform similar to Facebook, where users can create profiles, post content, interact with others, and build connections. A well-structured database is essential for handling large amounts of data efficiently, especially with features like friend requests, likes, comments, and messaging. The goal is to create a reliable, scalable, and efficient database that supports fast data retrieval, secure storage, and real-time interactions while maintaining relationships between users, posts, and groups.
